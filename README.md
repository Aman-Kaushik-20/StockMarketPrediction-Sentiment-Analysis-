# StockMarketPrediction-Sentiment-Analysis-
In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict stock market movements based on news headlines using Python and popular libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, and NLTK.
- Conducted data cleaning operations, including removal of punctuations and conversion of text to lowercase, to prepare the dataset for analysis.
- Utilized Bag of Words (BoW) technique to transform news headlines into numerical features, employing CountVectorizer from Scikit-learn for creating a matrix representation essential for model input.
- Employed Random Forest Classifier to train the model, leveraging its aptitude for classification tasks and its demonstrated efficacy in predicting stock market movements using textual data.
- Evaluated model performance through diverse metrics such as confusion matrix, accuracy score, and classification report, providing comprehensive insights into its predictive capabilities.
